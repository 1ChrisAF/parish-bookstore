# parish-bookstore
Rough draft for a parish bookstore project.

Note: I am aware that some models are basically duplicates of each other and need to be pared down. Right now I'm working on getting *a* complete, functioning product and will optimize things once that's done.

Alright.

I was planning on reorganizing the model structure AFTER bringing the app to full functionality, but as I'm working to create a fucntioning Cart, the need to overhaul the models *now* has become unavoidably clear. Better planning at the start would have prevented or at least mitigated the need for a full-stop to reorganize at this point, but I guess that's part of why I'm working on this, to learn those "learn once, apply always" lessons. The other motivation for this project is, of course, to build a functioning bookstore site for my parish.

Even though a LOT of work has to be undone due to a shoddy start, there's a LOT of work that doesn't. The UI design stuff should be able to stand, and I already have a better understanding of a lot of concepts that required further learning earlier, so given that I was able to get *this* far in a week on my first "freelance" project, I don't expect reorganizing and picking back up will take terribly long. 

Anyways, lesson learned: while no plan survives first contact, no first contact is survivable without *a* plan.
